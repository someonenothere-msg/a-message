I have been wandering a lot in this place.
I thought I was searching for something,
something to inspire,
but there is nothing actually,
Instead, everything is already in my hands.

I am not someone from here
I am just a visitor, a wanderer.
Staying here for some of my life.

*

Train Station

A train station,
It resonates, resonate to events of life,
We comes and goes, 
Being carried and left,
Sometime with destination, sometime not.

I wonder how was it when it was present.
Now it is a place to imagine.

*

Graveyard

I know none of them personally,
But I know they are here to be memorial,
As someone who had been here around once upon a time,
Grave is one of the way to prove they were here,
Without them knowing.

*

Lake

'I was waiting for the perfect day 
when I became the surface of a lake 
lying in the Tibetan mountains.
It has been reflecting everything 
for countless thousand of years.
I was waiting for a calm day.
The sky dissolved into the lake;
Clouds flowed over the lake;
Migrating birds crossed over the lake.
A sudden wind carried everything away
Toward the shore of the lake
And the sky stretched over us all again.
We have everything already in our hands.'

the brush (playground)

I might not see,
But I hear them,
It sounds familiar yet different,
I was familiar with the sound from upon my head,
Now they are around my feet.

I do not see, but I know they are here, present.

*

Hidden exit

Into the elevated brush,
I am now hidden, yet seeing and hearing,
Like a predator, yet a prey.

But I got no enemy, just a wanderer, a outsider,
Leave with less traces, yet I am here, I was here.
